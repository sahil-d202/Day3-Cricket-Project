    <h2>Information About Cricket</h2>
    <p>
      Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players
      on a field, at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch
      with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks)
      balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team, the striker
      and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one
      player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the
      striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch.<br />
      The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch
      places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each
      of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the
      boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally. The fielding
      team aims to prevent runs by dismissing batters (so they are "out").

      <br />
      Forms of cricket range from traditional Test matches played over five days
      to the newer Twenty20 format (also known as T20), in which each team bats
      for a single innings of 20 overs (each "over" being a set of 6 fair
      opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasts
      three to four hours.
